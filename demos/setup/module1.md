<!-- ## Optional Features

### 30 Billion Rows Dataset

The WWI environment can be populated with 30 billion records to demonstrated large data scenarios. Due to the limits of Azure Cloud Shell's 20-minute runtime, the automation has to run on a stand-alone machine against your subscription to be able to go through the 4-5 hours long data loading process. If you decide to go with the 30 billion records option, use a local Powershell instance with admin privileges instead of Azure Cloud Shell.

1. [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to your computer.

2. Navigate to a folder location you prefer on your computer and execute the command below to download automation scripts and artifacts.


    ```PowerShell
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement.git synapse-wwi
    ```
    
    ![The Azure Cloud Shell window is displayed with the choices of different data sizes that can be loaded into the environment by the script.](media/local-git-clone.png)

3. Execute the following command to authenticate your powershell session with your Azure Subscription:

    ```cli
    az login
    ```
    
4. Execute the following command to authenticate the script session with your Azure Subscription:

    ```cli
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```
    
5. Continue your environment setup from [Task 7 in the Before Starting guide](#task-7-run-environment-setup-powershell-script)).

### Twitter Developer Account Application

The Twitter Real-Time Analytics report in you created during task 10 can be connected to the real world, and fetch real-time tweets from twitter instead of the simulator deployed as part of your environment. In order to connect your report to Twitter you will need a Twitter Developer Account. Below are the steps to apply for one.
